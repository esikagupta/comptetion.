                        This company is well organized and pays well. I have been using them for over a decade and have never had any problems. We have a 40yd scrap it container on site. It is emptied any time we call and the drivers are courteous and pick up any loose material. The second street yard is wild but they pay and weigh with all your weights shown to you upon receipt. I have never had to question the weights all is legitimate. I am very happy with this company!                    </p>

                        This was my first time actually bringing in scrap personally. Let me tell you, ... my experience here was nothing but wonderful. Shout out to the guys in yard, they treated me so great in helping and guiding me threw the process. These guys are a 10 in my book. I plan on using this company many more times in the future.                    </p>

                        I have scrapped a lot of copper lead and steel and they are very helpful and in my experience pay out more than the other scrap yards in the area.I’ve been to a lot of scrap yards, but I have to say they have the friendliest employees. They always make my drop quick and easy.                    </p>

                        This company is well organized and pays well. I have been using them for over a decade and have never had any problems. We have a 40yd scrap it container on site. It is emptied any time we call and the drivers are courteous and pick up any loose material. The second street yard is wild but they pay and weigh with all your weights shown to you upon receipt. I have never had to question the weights all is legitimate. I am very happy with this company!                    </p>

                        I have scrapped a lot of copper lead and steel and they are very helpful and in my experience pay out more than the other scrap yards in the area.I’ve been to a lot of scrap yards, but I have to say they have the friendliest employees. They always make my drop quick and easy.                    </p>

                    Stepping into a scrape yard reveals a mesmerizing labyrinth of piled cars, towering heaps of metal, and endless rows of salvageable items. While the atmosphere may seem chaotic at first glance, these yards operate with a carefully orchestrated system.

                    Scrape yards play a vital role in the global recycling ecosystem, promoting environmental scavenging . By collecting, sorting, and processing scrap materials, these yards reduce the need for raw materials.                 </p>
